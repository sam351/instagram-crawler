The constant scrolling has ironically made me feel more disconnected.

After all everyone wants to see an exciting life, not a boring everyday life with real ups and downs. Right? ⁣\n⁣\nI'm feeling more like myself now, I think spending time with my sister has brought me a lot of peace. I've also realised that I care about real connections with people, I care about content creation, but I cannot be an 'entertainer'. It might be for others but it is just not me. Social media is awesome. But it also exposes us to a tremendous amount of materials that can quickly become overwhelming. I would advice everyone to make sensible choices about what you will like to be exposed to or to see. Remember it should be a tool to enrich your life, not to make you feel inadequate.⁣\n⁣\nIt warms my heart that so many of you had actually sensed my low mood and had reached out asking if I'm ok.

Looking back, I definitely feel our photography style has evolved a lot. What do you think? 😊⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nWhen we first started out, we paid for every single aspect of our travels like flights, hotels, outfits, food, to things you don't think about like airport parking. Just so we can capture images that we love ourselves and to inspire people to travel. And... Surprise surprise... we still pay for most stuff ourselves nowadays. ⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nIf you have watched my stories yesterday, you would have seen my frustration over brands/companies proposing to \"gift\" me all sorts of items, on a daily basis. I know most of us love receiving gifts but the *gifts* proposed to me comes with a catch. There is a set of deliverables on my social media channel in exchange that I have to do. So essentially, it is not gifting at all. I call it \"gifting in disguise\".⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nI'll be honest - when I first started out, I did accept some of these so-called *gifts*. It was a time when I felt that I needed to proof myself and would say yes to basically anything. ⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nHowever as my experience along with this community grew, I feel a strong sense of responsibility to you wonderful people to only promote things I genuinely love and would recommend to my own family.\n⁣⁣⁣\nMost of the stuff that were offered to me are either stuff that I don't need, don't know about or don't use. So it would be very wrong for me to start promoting it all over my channel. It would also break my heart if any of you decide to go out there to buy the stuff that I don't even believe in myself, with your hard-earned money. ⁣⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nI urge my fellow creators to think long & hard before saying yes to any *gifts* offered to you. If you are passionate about content creation like me, you'll know that it is not just merely taking photos in your back garden (unless of course you're lucky enough to live somewhere with a view like the one I had for one night in Venice 😉). These *gifts* do not compensate for our expenses, time, creativity let alone pay for our livelihood.⁣⁣\n⁣⁣⁣\nI'll be interested to hear your thoughts 🙆🏻‍♀️"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2T_F6ZgyXv/", "datetime": "2019-09-12T13:08:24.000Z", "img_urls": ["https://scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/69237976_2539490036272258_2079802826985033776_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=q31j8cQZt2EAX9DOZ-h&oh=ab117576e8ce8f4ffa5e81af491e90e8&oe=5F0044D5", "https://scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/71107437_2407431409473105_381359630312541661_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-ssn1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=fE3NFTE_OzUAX-PXHSt&oh=b832cfda3baa06fcce47e0f9327cca5b&oe=5E4D6020"], "likes": 4260, "caption": "Whatever you do, do it with passion, with full awareness and attention.

It has always been factors like location, reviews, and value for money. ⁣\n⁣\nThat is, until I took the plunge and booked this room. It cost a lot more than what we would normally pay for accommodation but I remember vividly how surreal it was to be able to watch the world float by outside our window. ⁣\n⁣\nMy Instagram account took off after this trip as my photos were shared by several huge accounts which had gained me a sizeable number of followers. ⁣\n⁣\nWhat nobody knew was, we had only booked this room for one night (with the remaining nights in a B&B with no view to compensate). ⁣\n⁣\nThank you @delyais for recreating this special moment and turning it into an incredible piece of artwork.
